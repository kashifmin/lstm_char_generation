# lstm_char_generation
A simple stacked LSTM model for generating next char given a sentence.

# Dataset
I've used a dataset containing verses of The Quraan and normalized to include only [a-z.\s\n] characters.

# Todo
* Fix overfitting
* Train on a larger dataset
* Replace one hot vectors with to_categorical instead

# Please feel free to send a PR if you have any improvements :)
